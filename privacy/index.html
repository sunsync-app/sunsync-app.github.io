        <h1>No data collection</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, the only data collection from this app would be from the use of google services, namely, the places api, and analytics.
            As this app the created with Flutter, standard flutter packages found on pub.dev can be references to see how these are implemented.
            There is no backend created for this app.  We neither receive nor store anything.  Please refer to Google's privacy policy for how any data may be used.
            However, no personal information is shared with them.  In our analytics web panel from Google, it is just generic app usage data, so we can assess popularity and issues.
            Using the app you can tell clearly that you never enter personal information.  We don't even offer getting your location from the device, you have to type it in.
            You're free to use a general location in your area or region for still fairly accurate results.  
            We are even soon rolling out an offline feature, where you can input coordinates, and the times are calculated on device, as they always are.
            Addtionally, coordinates are sent to https://www.timeapi.io/ to get a utcoffset which is saved.
        </p>
